# Draw-Doraemon-Using-Python

# Introduction:
In Python, the turtle is one of the most interesting libraries which enables the user to create pictures on a virtual canvas, with the help of the in-built functions of this library we can see the magic of art. In this project, with the help of this library, we will create a cartoon character “DOREMON”.

# Explanation:
To draw any picture, we need to first look at all the small elements which will get combined to form a complete picture that matches our imagination. In the same way, for this project as well, first of all, we will code for all the small elements in various functions accordingly and then will combine them into another function which will sum up all these to get the picture of the cartoon character.

The basic need for drawing this character is to draw

The Head
The eyes
The mouth
The band
The whiskers
The band
The nose
The face
The body
The first function we made in this project is “my_goto(x,y)”. This function will help the turtle( The onscreen pen used for drawing is called turtle) to move at the specified location x,y. Under this function, we made use of two more functions “penup()” & “pendown ()”. The penup() function means that no line will be drawn when the pen moves and the pendown() function means that a line will be drawn when the pen moves. Overall this UDF says that when the function gets called the pen will move to a desired location given by the user and after that, it must draw at that particular position. Now you all are wondering how we should specify the location. So for these, we make use of coordinates. The screen is divided into four quadrants and accordingly, we give the location.

# Output :
The doraemon drawing is displayed...
